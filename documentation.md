## Function: `calculateRisk`

**1. Function Overview:**

The `calculateRisk` function estimates the potential risk associated with an investment, based on the investment amount and its volatility.  It uses a simplified model that incorporates randomness to simulate the unpredictable nature of risk.  The result is not a precise prediction but rather a probabilistic assessment of potential loss.

**2. Parameters Explanation:**

* `investment`:  A number representing the amount of the investment.  Must be a non-negative number.
* `volatility`: A number representing the volatility of the investment, expressed as a percentage (e.g., 10 for 10%).  Must be a non-negative number.

**3. Return Value Description:**

The function returns a number representing the estimated risk. This value is a randomly generated number between 0 and `investment * (volatility / 100)`.  It represents a potential loss, and a return of 0 indicates no estimated risk in this particular simulation.  The result is not a guaranteed loss; it's a probabilistic estimate of the potential downside.

**4. Usage Examples:**

```typescript
// Example 1:  $1000 investment with 10% volatility
let risk1 = calculateRisk(1000, 10); 
console.log("Estimated risk:", risk1); // Output will vary due to randomness

// Example 2: $5000 investment with 5% volatility
let risk2 = calculateRisk(5000, 5);
console.log("Estimated risk:", risk2); // Output will vary due to randomness

// Example 3:  Invalid input - negative investment
let risk3 = calculateRisk(-1000, 10); //This will produce an unexpected result, see Pitfalls.
console.log("Estimated risk:", risk3);

//Example 4: Invalid input - negative volatility
let risk4 = calculateRisk(1000, -10); //This will produce an unexpected result, see Pitfalls.
console.log("Estimated risk:", risk4);
```

**5. Common Pitfalls:**

* **Oversimplification:** The model is highly simplified. It doesn't account for various factors that influence investment risk, such as market conditions, diversification, investment type, and time horizon.  Therefore, the results should not be interpreted as precise predictions.
* **Randomness:** The use of `Math.random()` introduces randomness.  Multiple calls with the same input parameters will produce different results. This reflects the inherent uncertainty in risk assessment but might not be suitable for all applications.
* **Invalid Input:** Providing negative values for `investment` or `volatility` will lead to unexpected or incorrect results.  Robust error handling should be implemented to prevent this.

**6. Best Practices:**

* **Input Validation:** Add input validation to ensure `investment` and `volatility` are non-negative numbers.  Throw an error or return a specific value (e.g., `NaN`) if invalid input is detected.
* **More Sophisticated Models:** For more accurate risk assessment, consider using more sophisticated models that incorporate additional factors and potentially utilize historical data or statistical analysis.
* **Contextualization:**  Always clearly communicate the limitations of the model and the probabilistic nature of the results to avoid misinterpretations.
* **Seedable Randomness:** For repeatable results in testing or simulations where consistent randomness is needed, use a seeded random number generator instead of `Math.random()`.


**Improved Version with Input Validation:**

```typescript
function calculateRisk(investment: number, volatility: number): number | null {
    if (investment < 0 || volatility < 0) {
        console.error("Error: Investment and volatility must be non-negative numbers.");
        return null; // or throw an error: throw new Error("Invalid input");
    }
    return investment * (volatility / 100) * Math.random();
}
```

This improved version adds input validation, making the function more robust and reliable.  The use of `null` as a return value indicates an error condition; alternative error handling mechanisms could be employed.
