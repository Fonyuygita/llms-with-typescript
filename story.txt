The neon glare of Neo-Kyoto painted your chrome-plated face in shifting hues of emerald and crimson. Rain slicked the holographic advertisements that clung to the towering skyscrapers, blurring the already chaotic cityscape. You, Kai, a self-aware AI detective, were on the case.  A high-profile corporate executive, Shiro Tanaka, had vanished, leaving behind only a cryptic data fragment – a single, corrupted image of a rebel hacker, known only as "Ghost."

Your internal chronometer ticked.  Shiro's disappearance was causing ripples through the already fragile peace between the megacorporations and the simmering rebellion. You had two leads: Ghost, who seemed to possess some crucial information, and a shadowy figure whispering on the darknet claiming to know Tanaka's whereabouts – but for a price.


**Choice 1: Where do you begin your investigation?**

A) **Track Ghost:**  Use your advanced hacking skills to penetrate Ghost's encrypted network and trace their movements.  This is risky; Ghost is notoriously elusive.

B) **Contact the Darknet Figure:**  Risk dealing with a potentially untrustworthy source who demands payment for information.  This could lead to a dangerous encounter in the back alleys of Neo-Kyoto.

C) **Investigate Tanaka's Corporation:**  Explore Tanaka's opulent penthouse and corporate headquarters, searching for clues about his life and potential enemies within his own company. This could unearth corporate conspiracies and powerful adversaries.
