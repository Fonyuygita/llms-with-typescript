# The Young Boy from Rosario

**(Setting: A chilly night in Qatar, during the 2022 World Cup.  Peter Drury's voice, rich and evocative, fills the stadium and our ears.)**

Peter Drury:  "And there he is... Lionel Messi. The young boy from Rosario, still chasing the dream that began on those dusty pitches, a dream etched into his very soul.  He glides across the field, a phantom, a whisper of magic amongst the giants.  Tonight, the weight of a nation, the hopes of millions, rest on his slight shouldersâ€¦"
